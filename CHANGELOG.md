# Version 0.1.2
+ Bot has been rewritten to a very similar base and structure as Shinshi, but without Dependency Injection due to complex implementation, so far.
+ Simplified getting and caching the right stuff, like language roles, channels and emoji to avoid using constats...
+ `about` slash command has been added.
+ Updated bot's design to Shinshi's new design. (really smart)

# Version 0.1.1
+ Absolute imports.
+ Environment variables example.
+ Add a LICENSE file and append license to each file, CHANGELOG and README.
+ Optimization.
+ ðŸŽ„ Add a task that changes the count of days until the new year! 
> so don't judge me harshly, especially CHANGELOG. (@stefanlight8)

# Version 0.1.0
There is no changelog, because this is first version.
